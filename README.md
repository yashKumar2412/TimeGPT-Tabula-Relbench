# TimeGPT-Tabula-Relbench
As part of my Data Mining coursework, I have created this assignment repository to display my work on TimeGPT, Tabula, and Relbench.

There are three sections:
1. TimeGPT - TimeGPT is a time-series forecasting and analysis tool by Nixtla, leveraging advanced machine learning and AI models to predict and analyze temporal data. 
It's designed for scenarios where businesses need accurate predictions over time, such as demand forecasting, financial market analysis, or weather predictions.

2. Tabula - Tabula is a framework that combines structured (tabular) and unstructured data to create enhanced predictive models. 
It's particularly useful for datasets that mix numeric, categorical, textual, or other forms of data.

3. Relational Deep Learning - Relational Deep Learning is a paradigm that focuses on learning representations and patterns from relational data.
This type of data is typically organized in a way that captures relationships between entities, such as those found in knowledge graphs, social networks,
or tabular data with complex interdependencies.
